	Limitations
		1.You can only call subs in the DBM by calling it through a function call. 
		2.To my understanding you cannot edit the UI as it requires a universal button handler which has not yet been implemented
			Note : Though a universal even handler has been implemented it is recommended to only mod the menu. Also note that you right now cannot override a inbuilt command
			as any updates to the GW will cause the program to call up its hard-coded defines . So make up new buttons and Menu options etc
	Warning
		1. The Command Function Parses your SQL statements before inserting them. This can result in slower speeds.
